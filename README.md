# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

Two employees from the Colorado Board of Elections needed assistance to complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election. The audit included the following tasks:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Identify each candidate who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes that each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes that each candidate received.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
6. Identify each unique county that cast votes.
7. Calculate total county votes.
8. Calculate the percentage of votes each county received.
9. Identify the county with the highest number of votes.

## Election Audit Summary

With this analysis completed, we can see that the program successfully referenced the source data, performed the expected calculations, and summarized the results in a text document. More importantly, this program can easily be adapted for future audits. If we assume that the data arrives in the same format from each local election, we only need to update two lines of code with the location and name of the source file and the text file where the results will be written. Those lines are shown here:
